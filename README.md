Modular Synth Power Supply

This PCB was designed to be the main power supply for a modular synth.
It takes its input voltage from a step down transformer, and converts it into the standard +/-12V and +5V used by all modular synths. 
The output uses the standard 10pin connector, and can interface with the 'Bus Board' to distribute power in the system.
